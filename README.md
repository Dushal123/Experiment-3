ðŸ§ª Experiment 3: Operators in C++

âœ… Aim:

To write a C++ program that demonstrates the use of various operators such as arithmetic, relational, logical, assignment, increment/decrement, and conditional operators.

ðŸ§  Theory:

Operators in C++ are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. They are essential for forming expressions and building the logic of any program. C++ provides a wide range of operators, each serving a specific purpose.

Operators are classified into the following categories:

1. Arithmetic Operators:
   
Used to perform basic mathematical operations:

+ (Addition), - (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus)

Example: sum = a + b;

2. Relational (Comparison) Operators:
   
Used to compare two values and return a boolean result:

== (Equal to), != (Not equal to), > (Greater than), < (Less than), >= (Greater than or equal to), <= (Less than or equal to)

Example: a > b

3. Logical Operators:

Used to combine multiple conditions:

&& (Logical AND), || (Logical OR), ! (Logical NOT)

Example: (a > 0 && b < 10)

4. Assignment Operators:
   
Used to assign values to variables:

= (Simple assignment), +=, -=, *=, /=, %= (Compound assignments)

Example: a += 5; (is equivalent to a = a + 5;)

5. Increment/Decrement Operators:
   
Used to increase or decrease the value of a variable:

++ (Increment), -- (Decrement)

They can be used in:

Prefix form: ++a, --a

Postfix form: a++, a--



6. Conditional (Ternary) Operator:
   
Used as a shorthand for if-else statements:

Syntax: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false;

Example: max = (a > b) ? a : b;

Conclusion:

In this experiment, we explored various operators in C++ and understood how they are used in expressions and conditions. Operators help perform calculations, make decisions, and control program logic, making them a vital part of programming in C++.
